## Realtime-Collab App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Real-Time Collaborative Task Manager with Drag and Drop Kanban Board

These were the needed tasks for this case:

Real-time Collaborative Task Manager:
Create a collaborative task management app using React, Redux, and WebSockets. Users should be able to create tasks, assign them to others, set due dates, and see real-time updates when tasks are added, completed, or modified by team members.

Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board:
Create a Kanban board application using React, Redux, and the React Beautiful Dnd library. Users should be able to create boards, add tasks, and drag tasks between columns. Persist the board's state using Redux and a backend API.

I mixed them up in this app.
